        <p>Bamyan comes from a literal phrase meaning, ‘the place of shining light’, so you can imagine why it was named
            such back in the days. What is now an ancient city of Afghanistan, once used to be part of the famous Silk
            Road, otherwise known as the Silk Route between the east and the west. A famous trade link where goods,
            gossips of empires, and ideas were exchanged amongst different civilisations of the time.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The city has been ruled by many empires including the Khushan Empire, Sassanids, Saffarids, Ghaznavids,
            Qarlughids. My god, you get the pattern, all the ‘id’s’, plus an addition of the Hephtalites,
            Kushano-Hephthalite and Genghis Khan of the Mongols that we all know. It’s no surprise that the city details
            a mixture of Indian, Chinese, Persian, Greek, and Turkish culture.</p>
        <p>We’ve talked about the history, so let’s get straight into the mystery of the city. If there’s one thing
            Bamyan is well known for, it is the Buddha’s encarved within the cliff of the mountain that overshadows
            Bamyan’s central village. A fascinating monument that not only beautifies the city but also adds some major
            sense of culture and pride to it.</p>
        <h2 id="SE3">The Giant Buddha’s</h2>
        <div class="pic">

                <h3>Buddha</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Giant Buddha of Bamiyan was a pair of monumental statues carved into the cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley in
            central Afghanistan. The statues, dating back to the 6th century, depicted the Buddha and stood at 55 meters
            (180 feet) and 35 meters (115 feet) tall. They were considered one of the most significant examples of
            ancient Afghan art and Buddhist heritage. However, in 2001, the Taliban destroyed the statues as part of
            their campaign against cultural artifacts, deeming them un-Islamic. The destruction of the statues was a
            global tragedy and highlighted the vulnerability of cultural heritage in times of conflict. Despite this,
            the site remains a symbol of Afghanistan's rich historical and cultural legacy.</p>

                <h3>Shahr-e-Gholghola</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Otherwise known as the ‘city of screams/sighs’, Shahr-e-Gholghola is a famous site in the centre of Bamyan
            city displaying the ruins of Genghis Khan from the 12th century. A time where thousands of Bamyani
            inhabitants were masssacred by the powerful Mongol army to avenge the death of Genghis’ nephew and grandson
            whom were murdered in Bamyan. A walk up the hill, you’ll notice little houses build on top of each other,
            some ruined and some still intact. There’s also a citadel that is almost half broken which stands at the
            very top of the hill-like village. A small house is also built right next to the village on the ground level
            for government workers who keep an eye on the place 24/7.</p>

                <h3>Kohi Azhdar</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The valley of dragon, otherwise refered to as Kohi Azhdar by Bamyani locals is another famous folktale of
            Bamyan. About ten minutes drive from Bamyan bazar (market), past the canyon-like village lays the famous
            Azhdar (dragon). Looks nothing like one, until you climb the rocky mountain. As you reach the top, you’ll
            notice a small Mazhar (shrine), a place where Hazrat Ali killed this enormous dragon. Below are pictures of
            the dragon’s back that was cut in half and the dragon’s eyes, still in crying mode and very salty. What a
            legendary tale! Should perhaps get a drone next time to view this dragon from above.</p>

                <h3>People</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The people of Bamyan are primarily from the Hazara ethnic group, one of Afghanistan's major ethnic
            communities. They predominantly follow Shia Islam and speak Dari, a dialect of Persian. Hazaras in Bamyan
            are known for their agricultural lifestyle, living in a region that produces crops like wheat, barley, and
            fruit. Despite facing historical marginalization and conflict, including the impact of the Taliban's rule,
            the people of Bamyan have maintained strong cultural traditions, including craftsmanship in weaving,
            embroidery, and stone carving. They are also recognized for their resilience and commitment to preserving
            their heritage amidst challenges.</p>
